               <h3>POTD 1</h3>
               <P>A company conducted an employee satisfaction survey where employees rated their satisfaction from 1 to 10. The company wants to analyze
                 the data to understand if there's a *consecutive streak of high satisfaction* (ratings above 7). Your task is to find the longest streak of consecutive ratings greater than 7.
                <br><br>
                Write a function `longestSatisfactionStreak(satisfaction)` that takes an array of integers, `satisfaction`, where each integer represents an employee's rating.
                <br><br>
                Input:
                An array `satisfaction` of integers (1 ≤ satisfaction[i] ≤ 10), where `1 <= len(satisfaction) <= 1000`.
                <br>
                Output:
                Return the length of the longest consecutive streak of ratings greater than 7.</P>
