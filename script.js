            Explanation: A hash table provides constant-time average performance for search operations, 
            meaning the time to search for an element does not depend on the number of elements in the table. 
            This is because a hash function is used to compute an index where the element is stored, and accessing
            that index directly takes constant time.`,
   
   sol7: `b) The array must be sorted <br><br>
            Explanation: Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. To do this efficiently, the array must be sorted (either in ascending or descending order) so that you can decide whether to search the left or right half based on the comparison with the middle element. <br><br>
            Also, Binary search can work on arrays containing any type of comparable elements (integers, floats, strings, etc.), as long as the array is sorted. Binary search can work on arrays with duplicate elements.

            * Pop a matching opening parenthesis from the stack when encountering a closing parenthesis.<br>
            If, at the end of the expression, the stack is empty and all characters were matched correctly, the parentheses are balanced. This Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks is ideal for this type of matching problem.`,

               Explanation: The insertion or deletion of an element at the beginning of an array has a time complexity of O(n).
               In the case of insertion, all other elements must be shifted one position to the right to create space for the new element.

   sol18:`O(n)<br><br>
                Explanation: Reversing a string using swapping requires n/2 iterations, as it swaps characters from both ends toward the center. In contrast, the copy method processes all n characters to create a new reversed string. Both approaches have a time complexity of O(n) , but swapping is more efficient due to fewer iterations and operations.`,

   sol22:`Wastage of memory if the elements inserted in an array are lesser than the allocated size. <br><br>
                  Explanation: For example, if we have an array of size 10 elements and we have inserted only 5 elements in an array then there is a wastage of 5 memory blocks which cannot be utilized by another variable.`,
   
   sol23:`9 <br><br>
               Explanation: The given code calculates the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) in the array a initialized as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Using a for loop, it iterates through the array, and the if (i % 2 == 0) condition ensures that only elements at even indices are added to sum. Specifically, the elements a[0] = 1, a[2] = 3, and a[4] = 5 are added, resulting in a total sum of 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Thus, the output of the program is 9.`,
   
   sol24: `Answer: Stack <br><br>

   sol34: `O(n) <br><br>
               Explanation: The recursive function reduces the input size by half at each step and makes two recursive calls. At each level of recursion, the number of calls doubles while the input size decreases. The recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(1) shows that the total work at each level is proportional to n. Adding up the work across all levels gives the overall time complexity as O(n).`,

               1. LinkedLists can implement stacks and queues using head or tail operations.  <br>
               2. Binary trees use nodes with references to left and right children, which can be implemented using a LinkedList structure. <br>

               Use a stack to find the boundaries of the unsorted subarray. <br><br>
               Explanation: The problem can be efficiently solved using either the two-pointer approach or a stack, both of which operate in  time. The two-pointer method works by identifying the boundaries of the unsorted subarray in a single pass from both ends. Similarly, using a stack helps efficiently track indices of out-of-order elements to determine the boundaries. These approaches are optimal compared to sorting or nested loops, which are slower and do not meet the  constraint.`,
   
   sol37: `O(nÂ²) <br><br>
               Explanation: The algorithm contains two nested loops, each running n times. The inner loop executes once for every iteration of the outer loop, resulting in a total of n x n =nÂ² iterations. Since the operation inside the loop is O(1), the overall time complexity is O(nÂ²).`,
   
   sol38: `O(n) <br><br>
               Explanation: The outer loop starts with i = n and halves i in each iteration   (i /= 2), making it logarithmic in nature. It runs approximately logâ‚‚(n) times.The inner loop runs from j = 0 to j < i. For each value of i, the inner loop executes i times.The total number of iterations is the sum of the inner loop's executions over all outer loop iterations: 
               n+(n/2)+(n/4).....=2n. <br>
               This is a geometric series summing to O(n).Therefore, despite the logarithmic outer loop, the overall complexity is dominated by the linear sum of the inner loop's iterations, resulting in O(n).`,
   
   sol39: `10 <br><br>
               Explanation: The given code has nested loops, where the outer loop runs with i from 0 to 3. For each value of i, the inner loop runs from j = i to j = 3. When i = 0, the inner loop executes 4 times (j = 0, 1, 2, 3), when i = 1, it runs 3 times (j = 1, 2, 3), for i = 2, it runs 2 times (j = 2, 3), and for i = 3, it runs once (j = 3). Thus, the total number of iterations of the inner loop is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. Therefore, the value of count after the loop completes will be 10, and the correct answer is 10.`,
   
   sol40: `When the graph contains negative edge weights. <br><br>
   Explanation: Dijkstra's algorithm fails when the graph contains negative edge weights because it assumes that once the shortest distance to a node is found, it cannot be updated. Negative weights can later lead to shorter paths, making this assumption invalid.`,

            - Rear pointer: Points to the position where the next element will be inserted. It does not point to the last occupied position in the queue. <br>
            The key concept in a circular queue is that when the rear pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning (index 0), making efficient use of the array space`,
   
   sol48: `Number of ways to climb n stairs starting from the 0th stair, if you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. <br><br>
               Explanation:
               The mystery function does not compute the Fibonacci series because mystery(0) = 1, whereas for Fibonacci, F(0) should be 0.<br>
               Now, consider the second option, which relates to the climbStairs problem.<br>
               If n == 0, it means you want to remain on the 0th stair starting from the 0th stair. There is only one way to achieve this, which is to do nothing. <br>
               If n == 1, it means you want to reach the 1st stair starting from the 0th stair. Again, there is only one way to do this, which is by taking a single step.<br>

It iterates through the array, maintaining a candidate element and a count to track its majority status. When the count reaches zero, it updates the candidate. For the input {3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1}, the function will return 2 as the majority element, since it appears more times than any other number.`,

               For the other options, A weighted graph is one where each edge has a weight or label associated with it, but it can have multiple edges between vertices if it's not simple. 
               A directed graph is one where edges have direction, but it can also have multiple edges between vertices if it's not simple. A cyclic graph is one that contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex), but this does not restrict the number of edges between vertices.`,
   
   sol72: `Isolated vertex <br><br>
            An isolated vertex in a graph is a vertex that has no edges incident on it, meaning it is not connected to any other vertex in the graph. <br>
             Adjacent vertex: Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge. This term does not describe a vertex with no edges. Incident vertex: This term is not commonly used in this context. Instead, an edge is said to be incident on a vertex if it connects to that vertex.
               Pendant vertex: A pendant vertex is a vertex with exactly one edge incident on it, making it connected to only one other vertex.`,

            When using the Lomuto partition scheme in QuickSort with the pivot always chosen as the last element, the worst-case scenario (e.g., a sorted array) results in nâˆ’1 recursive calls for an array of n elements. For n = 8, this means 7 recursive calls, as each call splits the array into a subarray of size kâˆ’1 and an empty partition, leading to a linear chain of nested calls`,

            adix sort is a sorting algorithm that does not use comparisons to sort data.

            In an AVL tree, the balance factor of a node is defined as the difference in height between its left and right subtrees. For the tree to remain balanced, the balance factor must be -1, 0, or +1. If the balance factor is outside this range (e.g., -2 or +2), the tree is considered unbalanced, and rebalancing operations are necessary to restore the AVL property`,

               Explanation: <br>
               The tree described is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent. However, the problem does not specify that the tree is balanced. If the BST is unbalanced (e.g., skewed into a linked list due to insertion order), the worst-case search time becomes O(n), as Nutty might need to traverse most or all nodes to find creature 42.`,

               Explanation: <br>
               In a binary search tree (BST), inorder traversal processes nodes in the order of left subtree â†’ root â†’ right subtree. Since the BST is structured such that: <br>
               - Left children represent genres with earlier release dates, <br>
               - Right children represent genres with later release dates, <br>
               inorder traversal will naturally output the genres in chronological order (ascending by release date). This matches the requirement to display movies sorted by release date within each genre.`,

   sol92: `b) The program will crash due to stack overflow. <br><br>
   
            Explanation: <br>
            The function fun(int n) is recursive, and each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. The recursion depth is determined by the value of n, which in this case is 1,000,000. Most systems have a limited stack size, typically in the range of a few megabytes, which translates to a maximum recursion depth of around 10,000 to 100,000 calls, depending on the system and compiler settings.
            <br>
            When fun(1000000) is executed, the recursion depth far exceeds this limit, causing a stack overflow. This happens because the call stack runs out of space to store the function calls, leading to a runtime error.`,
   
   sol93: `a) Full: (REAR+1) mod n == FRONT, empty: REAR == FRONT. <br><br>
   
               Explanation: <br>
               In a circular queue implemented with an array of n elements, where the capacity is n-1 elements, the conditions for detecting full and empty states are as follows: <br>
               - Full Condition: The queue is full when (REAR+1) mod n == FRONT. This condition checks if the next position after REAR wraps around to FRONT, indicating that all available slots are filled. <br>
               - Empty Condition: The queue is empty when REAR == FRONT. However, to distinguish between an empty queue and a full queue, the initial state of both REAR and FRONT being 0 is used to indicate an empty queue. If REAR == FRONT and the queue is not empty, it means there is exactly one element in the queue.`,

            The code snippet performs two operations: <br>
            Dequeue: It removes an element from the front of the queue by incrementing the front index and returning the value at the previous front position. <br>
            Return the front element: Before removing it, the code retrieves the value at the current front index, which is the front element of the queue. <br>

   sol95: `d) Calculate all distances and use a min-heap. <br><br> However, a more efficient approach is to use a min-heap directly without explicitly calculating all distances and storing them, as you can push elements into the heap based on their squared distances. Here's why each option is viable or not: <br>
   
               Explanation of Options: <br>
               a) Calculate distances, sort, and take the first k: This approach involves calculating the squared distances for all points, sorting them, and then selecting the first k points. This method has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting. <br> <br>
               b) Use a max-heap (priority queue) of size k: This approach involves maintaining a max-heap of size k. For each point, calculate its squared distance and push it into the heap if it's not full. If the heap is full and the new point is closer than the farthest point in the heap, remove the farthest point and add the new one. This method has a time complexity of O(n log k). <br><br>
               c) Use quickselect (a variation of quicksort): Quickselect is an algorithm that can find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array. It has an average time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for large datasets. However, it is more complex to implement compared to sorting or using a heap.<br><br>
               d) Calculate all distances and use a min-heap: This option is essentially similar to using a min-heap but implies calculating all distances first. In practice, you can push points into the heap based on their squared distances without needing to explicitly calculate all distances first. This approach is efficient but might be slightly less optimal than using a max-heap of size k.`,

            Inorder: 8, 6, 9, 4, 7, 2, 5, 1, 3 <br>

            However, without specific constraints on the tree structure, calculating the exact number of valid orders is complex. If considering all permutations without constraints, there would be 7! = 5040 arrangements, but this doesn't accurately reflect valid search paths in a BST.`,

               The recursive function works similarly to a recursive sequence series. The base case returns 1 for inputs less than or equal to 1. For even numbers, it recursively halves the input. For odd numbers, it breaks the problem into two recursive calls based on the half and half-plus-one pattern.`,

            Explanation <br>
            In Heapsort, we first build a heap, then we do following operations till the heap size becomes 1. a) Swap the root with last element b) Call heapify for root c) reduce the heap size by 1. In this question, it is given that heapify has been called few times and we see that last two elements in given array are the 2 maximum elements in array.

Here 8000 is greater than 4000 condition becomes true and it return at function(2*4000). Here n=4000 then 4000 will again print through second printf. Similarly print(2*2000) after that n=2000 then 2000 will print and come back at print(2*1000) here n=1000, so print 1000 through second print.

   Here are the advantages of adjacency list representation over adjacency matrix representation: <br>
   a) In adjacency list representation, space is saved for sparse graphs: Adjacency lists are more space-efficient, especially for sparse graphs, as they only store existing edges, whereas adjacency matrices require O(V^2) space regardless of the number of edges. <br>
   b) DFS and BFS can be done in O(V + E) time for adjacency list representation: These operations are more efficient in adjacency lists because they allow direct iteration over all edges of a vertex, resulting in a time complexity of O(V + E). In contrast, adjacency matrices require checking all possible edges, leading to a time complexity of O(V^2) for these operations.<br>
   c) Adding a vertex in adjacency list representation is easier than adjacency matrix representation: Adding a new vertex in an adjacency list is simpler and more efficient than in an adjacency matrix, which requires updating the entire matrix structure.`
